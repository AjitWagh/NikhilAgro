<p class="font-weight-normal"> Slow agricultural growth is a concern for policymakers as some two-thirds of India's people depend on rural employment for a living. Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-normal">The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials. Classes of foods include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, and meat. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-normal"> â€œAlthough the main purpose of this  is to increase the awareness that investing in agricultural land is a sound financial vehicle, it is also meant as an introduction to the joy of farming as a pleasurable way of life.Also not to see farming as a earning source although farming can be a way of living many people and also for animals which you can see the examples in our next slide ==> Life Changing Examples".
